If a particular portion of these guidelines is relevant only to a subset of those releases, this will be specifically noted. However, please note that Rawhide can change rapidly, and there will be times when changes are visible there which are not yet reflected here.</p><p>The guidelines also to some degree cover packages for EPEL, but only when combined with the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/epel-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EPEL packaging guidelines</a>.

Those assets <strong>MUST</strong> be added to the fedora-logos package. Your packages(s) install the logos by depending on the fedora-logos package. If the upstream contains Fedora trademark assets that you believe are used inappropriately, email <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">legal@fedoraproject.org</a></p><p>This is because the Fedora logo is a trademark, which are handled under a different legal framework than code. It must only be distributed under terms that protect the trademark. Keeping Fedora trademarks separate in their own package instead of scattered across various other packages is also an essential practice for enabling remixes that necessarily must <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Trademark_guidelines#Secondary_Mark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">not use the Fedora trademark</a>, and instead roll their own *-logos package or use the generic-logos package.</p><h2 id="libraries-and-applications" tabindex="-1">Libraries and Applications <a class="header-anchor" href="#libraries-and-applications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Libraries and Applications&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Many language- or domain-specific guidelines refer to &quot;libraries&quot;, &quot;modules&quot;, &quot;plug-ins&quot; or other terms specific to the language or domain. This is specifically important to package naming. Some applications may include libraries, and some libraries may include applications, so the distinction is not always clear.</p><h3 id="library-or-application" tabindex="-1">Library or Application? <a class="header-anchor" href="#library-or-application" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Library or Application?&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>If the primary purpose of a package is to provide executables to be run by users, it SHOULD be packaged as an application. If it also includes libraries which may be imported or linked to by other code, see <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/#_mixed_use_packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mixed Use Packages</a> below.</li><li>If the primary purpose of a package is to provide libraries intended to be imported or loaded into other code, it is considered a library and MUST be packaged as such. If it contains utility programs that can be run by users as well, see <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/#_mixed_use_packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mixed Use Packages</a> below.</li></ul><p>It is left to the packager to determine the primary purpose of a package. Often times upstream will already have done this with their choice of naming and that choice SHOULD be followed by the Fedora packager.</p><h3 id="mixed-use-packages" tabindex="-1">Mixed Use Packages <a class="header-anchor" href="#mixed-use-packages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mixed Use Packages&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Many packages, regardless of their primary purpose, include both applications and libraries. In this case one or both SHOULD be packaged in subpackages in order to allow other applications to depend on only the library and not the associated application(s). Installing an application that depends on a library or service should not automatically pull in other applications associated with that library or service.</p><h2 id="package-independence" tabindex="-1">Package Independence <a class="header-anchor" href="#package-independence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Package Independence&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Packages SHOULD be installable independently whenever this is technically feasible, but they MUST specify dependencies of correct type on other packages if necessary, see <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/#_dependency_types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dependency Types</a> below.</p><p>Desktop applications MUST NOT depend on other desktop applications unless strictly required. In particular, packages that contain a visible <code>.desktop</code> file (a <code>.desktop</code> file that does not contain the line <code>NoDisplay=true</code>) SHOULD NOT have a <code>Requires</code>,<code>Recommends</code>, or <code>Supplements</code> on any other package containing a visible desktop file, directly or indirectly.</p><p>For example, it would be reasonable for a video game level editor to require the associated video game in order to function, or for an application’s plugin to require the associated application. But it would not be reasonable for an application that happens to use a database library to depend on a database management suite associated with that library, or for an application that happens to use a particular programming language to depend on management tools associated with that programming language.</p><p>If a source package provides multiple graphical applications, those applications SHOULD be packaged in separate subpackages when feasible.</p><h2 id="spec-files" tabindex="-1">Spec Files <a class="header-anchor" href="#spec-files" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spec Files&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The spec file (&quot;spec&quot;) is a fundamental element in the packaging workflow. Any change that is made to the package will include a change to the spec. Because packages in Fedora are maintained by a community of packagers as well as automated tooling, it is important for the specs to follow certain conventions. The bulk of these packaging guidelines involves what goes into a spec, but here are a few general items.</p><h3 id="spec-file-naming" tabindex="-1">Spec File Naming <a class="header-anchor" href="#spec-file-naming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spec File Naming&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The spec file MUST be named <code>%{name}.spec</code>. That is, if your package is named <code>example</code>, the spec file must be named <code>example.spec</code>.</p><h3 id="spec-legibility" tabindex="-1">Spec Legibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#spec-legibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spec Legibility&quot;">​</a></h3><p>All spec files MUST be legible and maintained in such a way that the community of packagers is able to understand and work with them.</p><p>To help facilitate legibility, only macros and conditionals for Fedora and EPEL are allowed to be used in Fedora Packages. Use of macros and conditionals for other distributions, including Fedora derivatives, is not permitted in spec files of packages in the main Fedora repositories unless those macros and conditionals are also present in Fedora.</p><h3 id="spec-file-encoding" tabindex="-1">Spec File Encoding <a class="header-anchor" href="#spec-file-encoding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spec File Encoding&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Unless you need to use characters outside the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ascii_full.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ASCII repertoire</a>, you will not need to be concerned about the encoding of the spec file. If you do need non-ASCII characters, save your spec files as UTF-8. If you’re in doubt as to what characters are ASCII, please refer to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ascii_full.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this chart</a>.</p><h4 id="non-ascii-filenames" tabindex="-1">Non-ASCII Filenames <a class="header-anchor" href="#non-ascii-filenames" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Non-ASCII Filenames&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Similarly, filenames that contain non-ASCII characters must be encoded as UTF-8. Since there’s no way to note which encoding the filename is in, using the same encoding for all filenames is the best way to ensure users can read the filenames properly. If upstream ships filenames that are not encoded in UTF-8 you can use a utility like convmv (from the convmv package) to convert the filename in your %install section.</p><h3 id="spec-maintenance-and-canonicity" tabindex="-1">Spec Maintenance and Canonicity <a class="header-anchor" href="#spec-maintenance-and-canonicity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spec Maintenance and Canonicity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Fedora’s git repository is the canonical location for Fedora spec files. Maintainers MUST expect that other maintainers and automated tooling will make changes to their packages, potentially without communicating prior to doing so (though communication is always encouraged). If some maintainers are also attempting to keep copies of a spec in an outside repository, they MUST be prepared to merge changes made to the spec in Fedora’s repository, and MUST NOT overwrite those changes with a copy from an external repository or using <code>fedpkg import</code>.</p><h2 id="source-file-verification" tabindex="-1">Source File Verification <a class="header-anchor" href="#source-file-verification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Source File Verification&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Where the upstream project publishes OpenPGP signatures of their releases, Fedora packages <strong>SHOULD</strong> verify that signature as part of the RPM build process.</p><p>Although a checksum in the sources file certifies that a file retreived from the lookaside cache is the one that the packager uploaded, it is silent on whether the file is what the upstream project released. A signature by the upstream developers certifies that the source is identical to what they released. Verifying the signature as part of the build ensures that packagers don’t forget to verify it.</p><h3 id="obtaining-the-correct-keys" tabindex="-1">Obtaining the Correct Keys <a class="header-anchor" href="#obtaining-the-correct-keys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Obtaining the Correct Keys&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The verification method requires one or more OpenPGP keyring files with public keys from the upstream project. The keyrings shall together contain all the keys that are trusted to certify the authenticity of the sources, and <strong>MUST NOT</strong> contain any other keys.</p><p>Ideally the upstream project publishes such a keyring as a downloadable file. You shall download that file and do everything you reasonably can to verify that it is authentic. Then you shall add it unmodified to the package SCM, and provide its URL in the spec file so that others can verify it. The URL <strong>MUST</strong> use HTTPS or a similarly authenticated protocol if at all possible.</p><p>Even if you are unable to verify the key at the first addition, it still enhances security in a trust-on-first-use way. It will ensure that future attacks will be detected if the key is the right one, or that a current attack will be detected later if future releases are signed by the correct key.</p><h3 id="verifying-signatures" tabindex="-1">Verifying Signatures <a class="header-anchor" href="#verifying-signatures" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verifying Signatures&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When source file verification is done, it <strong>MUST</strong> be done first in the <code>%prep</code> section of the spec file, before any potentially compromised code is executed. The verification <strong>MUST</strong> be done with the macro <code>%{gpgverify}</code>, which expands into a command whose parameters shall be the pathnames of the keyring, the signature and the signed file.<code>BuildRequires: gpgverify</code> is necessary for the verification to work.</p><p>Any detached signature file (e.g. foo.tar.gz.asc or foo.tar.gz.sig) must be uploaded to the package lookaside cache alongside the source code, while the keyring must be committed directly to the package SCM.</p><p>The following format must be used:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Source0: ftp://ftp.example.com/pub/foo/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz</span></span>

In this case the upstream OpenPGP keyring must still be included in the package SCM and the instructions/script used to build the stripped-down tarball needs to verify the upstream source.</p><p>If the upstream project does not publish a keyring file (for example if they publish only a fingerprint on their website and refer to a keyserver network for downloading the key), then you may need to create a keyring after you have verified the key. In this case there is no upstream URL to the keyring, so instead you should document how you created the keyring in a comment in the spec file. A minimal keyring with the key with the fingerprint <code>7D33D762FD6C35130481347FDB4B54CBA4826A18</code> can be created with the following command:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>gpg2 --export --export-options export-minimal 7D33D762FD6C35130481347FDB4B54CBA4826A18 &gt; gpgkey-7D33D762FD6C35130481347FDB4B54CBA4826A18.gpg</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If upstream signed a tarball differently, for example by signing only the uncompressed tarball but distributing a compressed version, then the verification step must be adjusted accordingly, for example:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Source0: ftp://ftp.example.com/pub/foo/%{name}-%{version}.tar.xz</span></span>

Each architecture listed in <code>ExcludeArch</code> needs to have a bug filed in bugzilla, describing the reason that the package does not compile/build/work on that architecture. The bug number should then be placed in a comment, next to the corresponding <code>ExcludeArch</code> line. New packages will not have bugzilla entries during the review process, so they should put this description in the comment until the package is approved, then file the bugzilla entry, and replace the long explanation with the bug number. The bug should be marked as blocking one (or more) of the following bugs to simplify tracking such issues:</p><h3 id="noarch-with-unported-dependencies" tabindex="-1">Noarch with Unported Dependencies <a class="header-anchor" href="#noarch-with-unported-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Noarch with Unported Dependencies&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Sometimes, you are working on a noarch package that can only run in locations that a different, arched package builds on. This is common for packages written in a scripting language which depend on the language’s interpreter package, for instance. If the arched package that your package deps on isn’t available on all architectures Fedora (or EPEL) targets you run into a situation where you may need to exclude your package from certain architectures&#39; package repositories or prevent it from building on certain architectures in the buildsystem.</p><h4 id="arch-specific-runtime-and-build-time-dependencies" tabindex="-1">Arch-Specific Runtime and Build-Time Dependencies <a class="header-anchor" href="#arch-specific-runtime-and-build-time-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Arch-Specific Runtime and Build-Time Dependencies&quot;">​</a></h4><p>You can limit both the architectures used to build a noarch package, and the repositories to which the built noarch package will be added, by using either the <code>ExcludeArch:</code> or <code>ExclusiveArch:</code> tags:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>BuildArch: noarch</span></span>

Packages must not contain unnecessary explicit Requires on libraries. We generally rely on rpmbuild to automatically add dependencies on library SONAMEs. Modern package management tools are capable of resolving such dependencies to determine the required packages in many cases. However, present versions of rpmbuild only add deps on library SONAMES, not the library’s full version. This can be a problem if a library has added features over the course of time without backwards incompatibilities that would cause SONAMES to be changed. This can lead to a case where the user has an old version of a library installed, the new version of the library with new ABI is built in Fedora and an application using that ABI is built. If the user just attempts to install or update that one application without also updating the library, the application will install fine (because the SONAME dependency is satisfied) but will fail when run because the library installed on the system is missing features it needs.</p><p>Although you do need to add explicit library dependencies to keep this from occurring, there are drawbacks to manually specifying this in all your packages. History has shown that such dependencies add confusion when library/files are moved from one package to another, when packages get renamed, when one out of multiple alternative packages would suffice, and when versioned explicit dependencies become out-of-date and inaccurate. Additionally, in some cases, old explicit dependencies on package names require unnecessary updates/rebuilds. For example, Fedora packages are only required to retain historical provides for two full release cycles.</p><p>Because of this and because we hope to have this fixed in rpmbuild, this is something to be aware of but it’s not required that you explicitly specify the libraries you require with their version information.</p><p>When explicit library Requires are necessary, explicit library dependencies should typically be arch-specific (unless the packages involved are noarch) and there should be a spec file comment justifying it:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span># The automatic dependency on libfubar.so.1 is insufficient,</span></span>

However, mixing these methods is problematic and may result in duplicated or conflicting files, so use of <code>%doc</code> with <em>relative</em> paths and installation of files directly into <code>%_pkgdocdir</code> in the same source package is forbidden.</p><p>Files marked as documentation must not cause the package to pull in more dependencies than it would without the documentation.

If some man pages are absent, packagers SHOULD work with upstream to add them. It is also occasionally possible to find pages created by other distributions, or to use the output of the <code>help2man</code> program; those are often useful as a starting point. When installing man pages, note that RPM will re-compress them into its preferred format. So the <code>%files</code> section MUST reference manpages with a pattern that takes this into account:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>%files</span></span>

However, if there is a good technical reason, packagers may choose not to use the default compiler. Examples of valid technical reasons to not use the default compiler, include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>The default compiler cannot build a package correctly.</li><li>The packager needs to disable a compiler feature (e.g. LTO) in order for the default compiler to correctly compile their package.</li><li>The default compiler takes significantly longer to build a package.</li><li>The default compiler is missing a feature that would benefit the package.</li></ul><p>Packagers choosing to use a non-default compiler should document the reason for this decision in a comment in the spec file.</p><h2 id="compiler-macros" tabindex="-1">Compiler Macros <a class="header-anchor" href="#compiler-macros" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compiler Macros&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If clang is being used to build a package, packagers must set the %toolchain macro to clang:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>%global toolchain clang</span></span></code></pre></div><p>rpm-spec</p><p>This ensures that Fedora’s clang-specific compiler flags are used when compiling.</p><p>If a packager wants to use conditional macros in a spec file to make it easier to switch between two different compilers, then the following macros names should be used:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>%bcond_with toolchain_clang</span></span>

Honoring means that the contents of that variable is used as the basis of the flags actually used by the compiler during the package build.</p><p>For C, C++, and Fortran code, the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/RPMMacros/#build-flags-macros-and-variables" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">%{optflags} macro</a> contains these flags. Overriding these flags for performance optimizations (for instance, -O3 instead of -O2) is generally discouraged. If you can present benchmarks that show a significant speedup for this particular code, this could be revisited on a case-by-case basis. Adding to and overriding or filtering parts of these flags is permitted if there’s a good reason to do so; the rationale for doing so must be documented in the specfile.</p><p>Packages SHOULD avoid editing the &#39;CFLAGS&#39; etc. environment variables by hand, and instead use methods for compiler flags manipulation described in <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/redhat-rpm-config/blob/rawhide/f/buildflags.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this documentation</a></p><h3 id="pie" tabindex="-1">PIE <a class="header-anchor" href="#pie" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;PIE&quot;">​</a></h3><p>PIE adds security to executables by composing them entirely of position-independent code. Position-independent code (PIC) is machine instruction code that executes properly regardless of where in memory it resides. PIE allows Exec Shield to use address space layout randomization to prevent attackers from knowing where existing executable code is during a security attack using exploits that rely on knowing the offset of the executable code in the binary, such as return-to-libc attacks.</p><p>In Fedora, PIE is enabled by default. To disable it in your spec, add:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>%undefine _hardened_build</span></span></code></pre></div><p>rpm-spec</p><p>If your package meets any of the following criteria you MUST NOT disable the PIE compiler flags:</p><ul><li>Your package is long running. This means it’s likely to be started and keep running until the machine is rebooted, not start on demand and quit on idle.</li><li>Your package has suid binaries, or binaries with capabilities.</li><li>Your package runs as root.</li></ul><h2 id="debuginfo-packages" tabindex="-1">Debuginfo Packages <a class="header-anchor" href="#debuginfo-packages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debuginfo Packages&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Packages should produce useful <code>-debuginfo</code> packages, or explicitly disable them when it is not possible to generate a useful one, but rpmbuild would do it anyway. Whenever a <code>-debuginfo</code> package is explicitly disabled, an explanation why it was done is required in the specfile. Debuginfo packages are discussed in more detail in a separate document,<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/Debuginfo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Packaging:Debuginfo</a>.</p><h2 id="devel-packages" tabindex="-1">Devel Packages <a class="header-anchor" href="#devel-packages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Devel Packages&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Fedora packages must be designed with a logical separation of files. Specifically, -devel packages must be used to contain files which are intended solely for development or needed only at build-time. This is done to minimize the install footprint for users. There are some types of files which almost always belong in a -devel package:</p><ul><li>Header files (foo.h), usually found in /usr/include</li><li>Static library files when the package does not provide any matching shared library files. See <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/#packaging-static-libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Packaging Static Libraries</a> for more information about this scenario.</li><li>Unversioned shared system library files, when a matching versioned shared system library file is also present. For example, if your package contains:</li></ul><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>/usr/lib/libfoo.so.3.0.0</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   /usr/lib/libfoo.so.3</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   /usr/lib/libfoo.so</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The versioned shared library files (/usr/lib/libfoo.so.3.2.0 and /usr/lib/libfoo.so.3) are necessary for users to run programs linked against libfoo, so they belong in the base package. The other, unversioned, shared library file (/usr/lib/libfoo.so) is only used to actually link libfoo to code being compiled, and is not necessary to be installed on a users system. This means that it belongs in a -devel package. Please note that in most cases, only the fully versioned shared library file (/usr/lib/libfoo.so.3.2.0) is an actual file, all of the other files are symbolic links to it. When a shared library file is only provided in an unversioned format, the packager should ask upstream to consider providing a properly versioned library file. However, in such cases, if the shared library file is necessary for users to run programs linked against it, it must go into the base package. If upstream versions the shared library file at a future point, packagers must be careful to move to the versioned layout described above.</p><h3 id="unversioned-shared-objects" tabindex="-1">Unversioned Shared Objects <a class="header-anchor" href="#unversioned-shared-objects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unversioned Shared Objects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As an additional complication, some software generates <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/Unversioned_shared_objects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">unversioned shared objects</a> which are not intended to be used as system libraries. These files are usually plugins or modular functionality specific to an application, and are not to be located in the ld library paths or cache. These types of unversioned shared objects do not need to go into a -devel package. They are only loaded at runtime and should be included in a private directory of the main package.</p><h3 id="exceptions-2" tabindex="-1">Exceptions <a class="header-anchor" href="#exceptions-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exceptions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are some notable exceptions to this packaging model, specifically:</p><ul><li>compilers often include development files in the main package because compilers are themselves only used for software development, thus, a split package model does not make any sense.</li></ul><p>When in doubt as to whether a file belongs in the base package or in -devel, packagers should consider whether the file is necessary to be present for a user to use or execute the functionality in the base package properly, or if it is only necessary for development. If it is only necessary for development, it must go into a -devel package.</p><p>As with all Fedora Packaging Guidelines, it is recognized that there are unique situations that fall outside of the boundaries of this model. Should you come across such a case, please open a ticket with the <a href="https://pagure.io/packaging-committee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fedora Packaging Committee</a> and explain it to us so that we can extend the Guidelines to address it.</p><h3 id="pkgconfig-files-foo-pc" tabindex="-1">Pkgconfig Files (foo.pc) <a class="header-anchor" href="#pkgconfig-files-foo-pc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pkgconfig Files (foo.pc)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The placement of pkgconfig(.pc) files depends on their usecase. Since they are almost always used for development purposes, they should be placed in a -devel package. A reasonable exception is when the main package itself is a development tool not installed in a user runtime, e.g. gcc or gdb.</p><h2 id="requiring-base-package" tabindex="-1">Requiring Base Package <a class="header-anchor" href="#requiring-base-package" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Requiring Base Package&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Subpackages are often extensions for their base package and in that case they should require their base package.

We don’t want to create a library that could conflict with upstream if they later start providing versioned shared libraries. Under no circumstances should the unversioned library be shipped in Fedora.</p><p>For downstream versioning, the name should be composed like this:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>libfoobar.so.0.n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <em>n</em> should initially be a small integer (for instance, &quot;1&quot;). we use two digits here (&quot;0.n&quot;) because the common practice with upstreams is to use only a single digit here. Using multiple digits helps us avoid potential future conflicts. Do not forget to add the SONAME field (see below) to the library.</p><p>When new versions of the library are released, you should use an <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_check_for_ABI_changes_in_a_package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ABI comparison tool</a> to check for ABI differences in the built shared libraries.

This allows developers to simply link against the unversioned library symlink and the dynamic linker will link against the correct object.</p><p>Keep in mind that although the filename is usually the library’s SONAME plus an incrementing minor version there’s nothing that intrinsically links these. ldconfig uses the SONAME as the value for a symlink to the actual filename. The dynamic linker then uses that symlink to find the library, disregarding the actual filename. The dynamic linker merely does a simple equality check on the field and does not check for ABI incompatibilities or similar problems. This is the main reason for using an <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_check_for_ABI_changes_in_a_package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ABI comparison tool</a> and incrementing the SONAME.</p><p>The SONAME field is written to the shared object by linker, using (at least in case of <code>ld</code>) the <code>-soname SONAME</code> flags.

In most cases it is fairly easy to work with upstream to fix these issues. Note that if you are updating a library in a stable release (not devel) and the package already contains *.la files, removing the *.la files SHOULD be treated as an API/ABI change — i.e., removing them changes the interface that the library gives to the rest of the world thus MUST follow Fedora policies for potentially destabilizing updates.</p><h3 id="packaging-static-libraries-1" tabindex="-1">Packaging Static Libraries <a class="header-anchor" href="#packaging-static-libraries-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Packaging Static Libraries&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>In general, packagers SHOULD NOT ship static libraries.</li><li>We want to be able to track which packages are using static libraries (so we can find which packages need to be rebuilt if a security flaw in a static library is fixed, for instance).

The files MUST then be checked into the Fedora Package revision control system (currently the git repos on pkgs.fedoraproject.org and commonly accessed via fedpkg). Storing the files in this way allows people to use standard tools to visualize the changes between revisions of the files and track additions and removals without a layer of indirection (as putting them into lookaside would do).</p><p>Applying patches directly from RPM_SOURCE_DIR IS NOT ALLOWED. Please see <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/RPM_Source_Dir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Packaging:RPM_Source_Dir</a> for the complete rationale.</p><p>The maintainer MAY deviate from this rule when the upstream of the package provides an extremely large patch or a tarball of patches against a base release. In this case the tarball of patches MAY be listed as a <code>SourceN:</code> line and the patches would be applied by untarring the archive and then applying the distributed patch(es) using the regular /usr/bin/patch command. Additional patches to the package (for instance, generated by the Fedora maintainer to fix bugs) MUST still be listed in <code>PatchN:</code> lines and be applied by %patch macros after the patches from the tarball were applied. Maintainers and reviewers should be cautious when exercising this exception as shipping an update as a patchset may be a sign that the patchset is not from the actual upstream or that the patches should be reviewed for correctness rather than simply accepted as the upstream code base.</p><h2 id="use-of-epochs" tabindex="-1">Use of Epochs <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-of-epochs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use of Epochs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>RPM supports a field called &quot;Epoch:&quot;, which is a numeric field, that, if set, adds another qualifier for RPM to use in doing package comparisons. Specifically, if set, the Epoch of a package trumps all other comparisons (except for a larger Epoch). If Epoch is not set in a package, RPM treats it the same as if it was set to 0.</p><p>Example:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Version: 1.2</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Epoch: 1</span></span></code></pre></div><p>rpm-spec</p><p>A package with those definitions would be considered greater than a package with a higher version or a higher release. Since Epoch is confusing to humans (and can never be removed from a package once used), it should only be used in Fedora <strong>as a last resort</strong> to resolve upgrade ordering of a package, and should be avoided wherever possible.</p><p>Also, Epoch complicates normal packaging guidelines. If a package uses an Epoch, it must be referred to in any place where <code>%{version}-%{release}</code> is used. For example, if a package being depended upon has an Epoch, this must be listed when adding a versioned dependency:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Requires: foo = %{epoch}:%{version}-%{release}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>rpm-spec</p><h3 id="epochs-from-third-party-repositories" tabindex="-1">Epochs from Third Party Repositories <a class="header-anchor" href="#epochs-from-third-party-repositories" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Epochs from Third Party Repositories&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If a package to be imported is or previously was present in a publicly accessible repository, the packager can optionally include an Epoch tag equal to that of the most recent version of the third-party package.</p><h2 id="symlinks" tabindex="-1">Symlinks <a class="header-anchor" href="#symlinks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Symlinks&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There are two ways of making a symlink, either as a relative link or an absolute link.

Packages that explicitly provide things that can be used in an arch-independent way (for example, those whose dependents don’t need to be of the same arch) need not apply this macro. In some cases, a package will supply multiple elements, some of which may be consumed only by dependents of an identical arch and some which may be consumed by dependents of any arch. In such cases, both arch-specific and arch-independent Provides: are warranted.</p><p>Examples of packages that should explicitly provide only arch-specific <code>Provides:</code> include native code libraries or plug-ins and their associated -devel packages. Packages that should explicitly provide only arch-independent <code>Provides:</code> include most stand-alone programs (in addition to all noarch packages). Even though these programs may themselves be arch-specific, clients that run them should not care about their arch in most cases. A package that explicitly provides, for example, both a native code library as well as an interpreted language interface to that library should have both arch-specific (for clients of the native code library) and arch-independent (for clients of the interpreted language interface) Provides:.</p><p>If there is no standard naming for a package or other long term naming compatibility requirements involved with the rename, the Provides should be assumed to be deprecated and short lived and removed in the distro release after the next one (i.e., if introduced in FC-X, keep in all subsequent package revisions for distros FC-X and FC-(X+1), drop in FC-(X+2)), and the distro version where it is planned to be dropped documented in a comment in the specfile. Maintainers of affected packages should be notified and encouraged to switch to use the new name. Forward compatibility Provides: in older distro branches can be considered in order to make it possible for package maintainers to keep same simple specfiles between branches but still switch to the newer name.</p><p>For packages that are not usually pulled in by using the package name as the dependency such as library only packages (which are pulled in through library soname depenencies), there’s usually no need to add the Provides. Note however that the -devel subpackages of lib packages are pulled in as build dependencies using the package name, so adding the Provides is often appropriate there.</p><h3 id="one-to-many-replacement" tabindex="-1">One-to-Many Replacement <a class="header-anchor" href="#one-to-many-replacement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;One-to-Many Replacement&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Sometimes a package is split into two or more packages (either subpackages or separate source packages) to make some components optional, but users of the optional parts shall be able to upgrade without losing the functionality. Thus the new packages need to be pulled in on upgrade from a version before the split. If some are later removed, they shall not be pulled in again on further upgrades.</p><p>This is achieved by putting an <code>Obsoletes:</code> tag like above in each of the packages that together replace the original package.

The interpreter used to run packaged applications cannot depend upon what the user has in their personal <code>$PATH</code>.</li><li>Files which are not installed as executables SHOULD NOT have shebang lines.</li><li>Language-specific guidelines may have additional restrictions.</li></ul><p>Shebang lines for executable scripts are automatically modified to convert calls to <code>env</code> into direct use of the proper executable in <code>/usr/bin</code>. Various checks are also applied to verify that the shebang lines are valid, and the build process can fail as a result of these. Finally, other language-specific modifications may also be made. It is thus generally unnecessary to manually modify executable scripts to fix <code>env</code> usage as long as this functionality is enabled.</p><p>If the automatic checks and modifications break a package, there are two primary options:</p><ul><li>The packager can elect to fix the shebang lines manually (using patches, scripting via sed, or other similar methods).</li><li>The packager can remove the executable permission from the script so that the checks and modifications are not made.</li></ul><p>If (and only if) the script needs to remain executable and cannot be modified to pass the checks, then the maintainer MAY elect to disable the checks and modifications. It is also possible to disable the functionality for specific paths or for specific shebang lines by setting <code>%__brp_mangle_shebangs_exclude_from</code> and <code>%__brp_mangle_shebangs_exclude</code>, respectively, using the same syntax as the settings described in <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/packaging-guidelines/AutoProvidesAndRequiresFiltering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Packaging:AutoProvidesAndRequiresFiltering</a>. It is also possible to disable the functionality entirely by adding <code>%undefine __brp_mangle_shebangs</code> near the beginning of the specfile.</p><h2 id="brp-buildroot-policy-scripts" tabindex="-1">BRP (BuildRoot Policy) Scripts <a class="header-anchor" href="#brp-buildroot-policy-scripts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;BRP (BuildRoot Policy) Scripts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>BRP scripts are injected at the end of <code>%install</code> (via the <code>%__os_install_post</code> macro) and perform some automatic sanity checks of, or adjustments to, files installed in the build root.</p><p>All packages SHOULD always be subject to all the BRP scripts, but sometimes it is necessary for a package to opt-out of certain ones. It is possible to disable any BRP script simply by defining the corresponding variable to <code>%{nil}</code>. For example, to disable the <code>brp-python-bytecompile</code> script:</p><div class="language-rpm-spec vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">rpm-spec</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span># Turn off Python bytecode compilation because this is a Jython</span></span>
